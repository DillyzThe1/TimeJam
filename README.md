# TimeJam
A game made for HaxeJam (Feb 2023) where you must correctly configure the forbidden machine to progress further.<br>
Jumping from place to place, you'll be fighting your way through enemies to collect a few archaic crystals, which may power the machine.<br>
If you get the machine wrong or fail to get sufficent power, you must restart in a slightly altered timeline, losing your progress while gaining a shortcut.<br>

# How To Play
Download the game [[here]](../../releases/latest/) for your platform and run it.<br>
<i>Note: Web builds are available [[here]](https://dillyzthe1.itch.io/)!</i><br>

After you've launched the game, you'll be greeted with this screen:<br>
